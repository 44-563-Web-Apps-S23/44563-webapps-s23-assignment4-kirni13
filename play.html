            MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
            <br>
            LANE. Say--where's the boss?
            <br>
            MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?[_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._
            <br>
            LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
            groceries for Sawyers.
            <br>
            MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
            which hangs beside the door._] Here.
            <br>
            LANE. What's the matter?
            <br>
            MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
            <br>
            LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
